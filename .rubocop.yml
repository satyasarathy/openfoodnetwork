# The configuration is split into three files. Look into those files for more details.

  # The automatically generated todo list to ignore all current violations.
  - .rubocop_todo.yml

  # Our Open Food Network style guide. It's used by Code Climate. If you want to see all violations,
  # then use only that configuration (like Code Climate):
  #
  #     bundle exec rubocop -c .rubocop_styleguide.yml
  #
  - .rubocop_styleguide.yml

  # A manually compiled todo list to ignore metrics violations on a file-by-file basis.
