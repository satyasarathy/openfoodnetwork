# Different EnterpriseFeeSummary::Scope DB result attributes are checked when dealing with
# enterprise fees that are attached to an order cycle in different ways.
#
# This module provides DB result to report mappings that are common among all rows for enterprise
# fees. These mappings are not complete and should be supplemented with mappings that are specific
# to the way that the enterprise fee is attached to the order cycle.
