# Find gaps in the sequence of payment ids.
# If there are gaps then see if there is a log entry with a payment result for
# the now lost payment. If there are some then you probably want to follow up
# with the affected enterprise and see if customers need to be refunded.
#
# ## Usage

# Report of the last 35 days:
#   rake ofn:missing_payments[35]
